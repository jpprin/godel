An open source fixed income portfolio management and OMS application.

I made this because all of the commercial systems I have seen and used
are either overcomplicated, including every possible type of asset
class - and all of their associated features - or straightforward but
extremely expensive.

This tool is intended for users managing a portfolio of cash bonds -
securities that can be traded on Euroclear, have an ISIN, etc.  The
intial goal is to focus on basic reporting tools for reporting
holdings and risk.  The eventual goal is to include an OMS to model
possible trades and to include a trade blotter.

This project clearly has a very long way to go, so any contributions
would be greatly appreciated.
